# DirectoryListingANE
Adobe AIR Native Extension for getting a directory's contents in Android.

This ANE is created because in some devices (in particular Samsung Galaxy Note 3 running android lollipop) the File's  getDirectoryListing and  getDirectoryListingAsync methods don't seem to return all the files.
